        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>
            Chef Johnâ€™s chicken saltimbocca is a next-level flavorful way to prepare chicken breasts. The quick and easy pan sauce is optional, but really elevates the dish, and a tangy salad of bitter greens and radish makes a fresh contrast between bites.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>4 to 8 sage leaves, or as needed</li>
                <li>3 thin slices prosciutto</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Marsala wine or white wine</li>
                <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
                <li>1/3 cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 lemon wedges (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 3/8-inch thickness. Season lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>With the smoother side of chicken breasts facing up, lay 2 to 4 sage leaves on each breast; more sage leaves will give a stronger sage flavor. Then, cover breasts with a single layer of prosciutto, covering the sage underneath.</li>
                <li>Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top, and press down firmly to flatten. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes before cooking for best results. </li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken, prosciutto-side down. in the pan, and sear until prosciutto is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Turn chicken over, and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 3 minutes more. Exact time will depend on size and thickness of chicken breasts.</li>
                <li>Turn off heat, remove chicken to a plate, and cover loosely with foil.</li>
                <li>For the sauce, add Marsala, lemon juice, and chicken broth to the pan, along with any accumulated juices from the plate with chicken, and place back over medium-high heat. Boil until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and swirl in butter until it disappears.</li>
                <li>Spoon sauce generously over chicken saltimbocca and add a lemon wedge on the side.</li>
            </ol>
